# Aligning Stable Diffusion with Noise Conditioned Perception
In this repository, we provide an implementation for the paper called "Aligning Diffusion Models with Noise Conditioned Perception".
We observe that aligning diffusion models in a pixel / latent space is not optimal in terms of learning speed and overall quality.
